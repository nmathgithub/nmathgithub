- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nmathgithub.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science, visualization, mathematics music, and cricket data!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about deep learning and artificial neural networks. 


I. Machine Learning/Deep Learning 

II. Mathematics 

- I am currently completing my PhD in mathematics at the University of Iowa. My area of research lies in hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs).
The PDEs I deal with have applications in traffic flow & biology (specifically chemotaxis). 

- I completed both my MS in Applied Mathematics & BS in mathematics with a minors in computer science and music from the University of Tulsa.
My mathematical interests included number theory and complex analysis. While completing my master's degree, I became interested in topics such as Statistical/Machine Learning, Stochastic Modeling, Bioinformatics, Graph Theory, Visualization, and Probability.

III. Music 

- I have been playing the violin for about 14 years and have participated in high school & university orchestras, youth symphonies, church concerts, and musicals. In undergraduate, I minored in music and became interested in music theory and music history.

With my interest in deep learning growing, I want to pursue projects involving classical music data sets.
A list of project ideas are as follows:

- Predicting Genre of Music Provided Training Sets 
- Classify Music as Bach or Non-Bach provided music clips from the Baroque sets

IV. Cricket Blog 

I run a cricket blog at https://brokencricketdreams.com/. 
One of my prior projects was proposing an alternative points system. The algorithm and data is documented here: https://brokencricketdreams.com/2021/06/17/alternative-world-test-championship-points-table-australia-should-be-in-the-world-test-championship-final-i-have-the-data-to-prove-it/
