## Past Personal Projects 
One of my prior projects was proposing an alternative points system, implementing the idea into an algorithm, and communicate the data & findings with readers from the cricketing world.

The algorithm and data is documented here:

## Currently Working On/Thinking About
With my interest in deep learning growing, I want to pursue projects involving classical music data sets.
A list of project ideas are as follows:

- Predicting Genre of Music Provided Training Sets 
- Classify Music as Bach or Non-Bach provided music clips from the Baroque sets

## Relevant Coursework

- Fundamental of Algorithms, Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics, Graph Theory, Visualization
- 
- Statistical/Machine Learning, Stochastic Modeling, Bioinformatics, and Probability

# II. Mathematics 

- I am currently completing my PhD in mathematics at the University of Iowa. My area of research lies in hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs).
The PDEs I deal with have applications in traffic flow & biology (specifically chemotaxis).  

- I completed both my MS in Applied Mathematics & BS in mathematics with a minors in computer science and music from the University of Tulsa.
My mathematical interests included number theory and complex analysis. While completing my master's degree, I became interested in topics such as 

Publication
Riemann Problem for a Non-Strictly Hyperbolic System in Chemotaxis https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/dcdsb.2021128

Conference Papers
An Algorithm to Reverse the Generalized Factorials Process http://sections.maa.org/okar/papers/2019/Mathur.pdf

# III. Other Interests


## Music 

- I have been playing the violin for about 14 years and have participated in high school & university orchestras, youth symphonies, church concerts, and musicals. In undergraduate, I minored in music and became interested in music theory and music history.


## Cricket Blog 

I run a cricket blog/website at https://brokencricketdreams.com/.
