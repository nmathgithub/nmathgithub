- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nmathgithub. I am a fourth year PhD candidate studying mathematics at the University of Iowa. My area of research is in partial differential equations (PDEs).

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in artificial intelligence, data science, visualization, mathematics, music, and cricket data! 


# Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Software Experience

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to further my understanding of deep learning, artificial neural networks, natural language processing, and computer vision by working on several personal projects. 

# I. Internships and Projects

## Internships 

### 1. Data Engineering Intern, Principal Financial Group (May-July 2022) ### 

- Main Project 

*Implemented a workflow by utilizing **AWS cloud infrastructure tools to calculate DORA Metrics** (DevOps Research and Assesssments) and produce a dashboard in AWS Quicksight to help teams work more efficiently*

*To accomplish this task, we worked with AWS CDK (in Python) and automated a workflow. We first wrote a chain of three lambdas and connected them via a StepFunction to extract relevant data from Github pull requests and Azure project/pipeline APIs. In the process, we validated the data (by using the pydantic library) and wrote the data to an S3 bucket. A new file in the S3 bucket would trigger a data transfer into DynamoDB (which itself was created by using AWS Glue), which was finally used to produce a dashboard in AWS Quicksight.* 

- Hackathon

*Created a website as a demo for a Personalized Onboarding Experience in four days. This **website was built using React.js & Node.js (hosted on AWS Amplify)**, which would take an individual's name & team as input and produce personalize webpages with relevant onboarding/installation information. As part of this project, we also made sure to implement several layers of security by using AWS Cognito.*

### 2. Information Technology, Accelerated Career Track Intern, Bank of Oklahoma (May 2018-May 2019) ### 

**Service Management & Automatation Team** 

*Assisted the team in a **company-wide release of ServiceNow**, a service management tool from the beginning of the process to the Go-Live Phase and beyond. Specifically, I assisted in the discovery & documentation of ServiceNow Configuration Management Database (CMDB), wrote scripts for ServiceNow notifications, and debugged/tested issues with the interface*

*The second project was part of the "Battle of the Interns," where a group of IT interns proposed a solution and provided a demo to company executives. We **created a digital dashboard to streamline prospecting in the bank**. In the process, I utilized SQL to explore the data and build visualization in R & PowerBI.*

### 3. Information Technology, Accelerated Career Track Intern, Bank of Oklahoma (May 2017-August 2017) ###

**Bank Data Warehouse & Salesforce Team**

*Helped **eliminiate techinical data by doing regression testing** for Salesforce (in Apex language). I provided value by increasing the test cases passed from 75% to 93%* 

*As part of the "Battle of the Interns" project", we **interviewed several teams across the bank** and gauged which teams needed a streamlined service management system. We **wrote a 30-page white paper and presented our findings** to company executives. The next year, the company implemented ServiceNow, and I was called back to work with the Service Management team.* 

## II. Personal Projects 

### Alternative World Test Championship Points Table ###

I write articles & maintain a cricket blog/website at https://brokencricketdreams.com/. One of the aspects of the blog is to think about current problems in the sport and propose innovations that can make it better. Here is one such project.

*Although the World Test Championship (WTC) is a good idea, it was not the greatest of systems at its inception. Over a course of a few articles, I exposed some of the shortcomings of the system, which lead me into thinking about an alternate system. A few months later, I put these ideas into action, created an algorithm that would make the WTC points table more balanced. and implemented it in R.*

*My **process of collecting and manipulating data, correspondings visualizations, and findings are documented here:** [Alternative World Test Championship Points Table](https://brokencricketdreams.com/2021/06/17/alternative-world-test-championship-points-table-australia-should-be-in-the-world-test-championship-final-i-have-the-data-to-prove-it/)


## Currently Working On/Thinking About

I want to combine my interests of deep learning, music, and cricket.

*I have been playing the violin for about 14 years and have participated in high school & university orchestras, youth symphonies, church concerts, and musicals. In undergraduate, I minored in music and became interested in music theory and music history.*

### List of Projects ###

- Predicting Genre of Music Provided Training Sets 
- Classify Music as 'Bach' or 'Non-Bach' provided music clips from the Baroque sets
- Predict a cricket team's likelihood of winning a World Cup or a league based on squad composition
- Implement a live scorecard on my website by reading official APIs (that refresh continuously) and formatting it in a presentable way
